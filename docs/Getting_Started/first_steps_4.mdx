- SHAFT is regularly updated to use the **[latest LTS JDK version]**. <FAIcon icon="fa-brands fa-java"/>
- We highly recommend using the latest stable version from **[IntelliJ IDEA]** as your IDE, but we also support [Eclipse]. <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-code"/>
- There are no other prerequisites. <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-person-running"/>

:::tip[**Learn before you use**]
To leverage the full capabilities of SHAFT you should already be familiar with the underlying framework that SHAFT is extending. For example, you should already know how to identify elements (id, selector, xpath ...etc.).
