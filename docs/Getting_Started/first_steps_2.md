## Understanding SHAFT's Foundation

SHAFT is built on top of Selenium WebDriver, which means you get all the benefits of the world's most popular test automation framework, plus much more.
- SHAFT is built on top of Selenium WebDriver, which means:
  - You can use everything you're already familiar with from the official **[Selenium WebDriver user guide]**.
  - It is fully compatible with **[W3C Standards]** and **[WebDriver BiDi]**.
  - It is empowered by the largest test automation community in the world.
  - It is backed by the most mature test automation infrastructure.
- SHAFT is highly reliable with built-in test synchronization that waits automatically for elements and actions.
- SHAFT comes with many out-of-the-box built-in features that are 100% configurable (No Magic 🪄).
- SHAFT is a coded test automation engine, making it highly maintainable and scalable.
  - You can use SHAFT with the latest `TestNG`, `JUnit5`, or `Cucumber`. 
  - You can implement the `Page Object Model` design pattern, `Fluent Design`, or any other pattern you choose.
- SHAFT provides direct access to all underlying APIs, which means:
  - You can easily return a native WebDriver object for Selenium or Appium.
  - You can easily return a Response object for Rest Assured.
  - You have full control over your own code with no forced syntax (No Limitations 💪).
