## Eclipse
- SHAFT uses [TestNG] for test management, thus you will need to install TestNG plugin.
- TestNG plugin comes pre-installed with IntelliJ but needs to be installed if you are using Eclipse.

### TestNG Plugin Installation
- Step #1: Once Eclipse is launched, click on Help and then Eclipse Marketplace.<br/>

  - Eclipse might show a warning regarding the installation of unsigned software, choose install anyway.<br/>
  - For the change to be effective, Eclipse will prompt for a re-start, choose re-start now.
